# 1.- Description üîé

The goal of this project was to practice what we have learned in the Business Intelligence chapter of this program. For this project, we have chosen a data set, explored it using Tableau, and put together a Story for presentation showing the insights we have derived from the data. The workbook was saved to Tableau Public.

# 2.- Repo Structure üìÇ
  -> data: 
 Contains the data set used during the project
  
  -> images:
 Contains the images set used during the project
 
  -> raw:
Contains the original data set downloaded from Kaggle

  -> tableau:
Contains Tableau file used during the project and the link to Tableu Public

 -> README.md:
Contains the main features needed to get a more comprehensive project

# 3.- Data source üóÉ

Data was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets):

- Formula 1 Race Data:
https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017

# 4.- Proceed ‚õè

- Found a data set to process: described at the previous step.
- Explored the data set and came up with a variety of visualizations that we could potentially include in our story.
- Break the project down into different steps - identify the entities/dimensions in our data set, explored them each individually, and then progressed to analyzing different combinations of them.
- Used the tools in our tool kit - the concepts and methods we have learned in the business intelligence chapter as well as some of the things we've learned in previous chapters.


# 5.-  Technical Requirements ‚öô

- Construct a Tableau Story consisting of at least 5 story points for the data set we have chosen.
- Use Story features such as captions and annotations.
- Use all the concepts we covered in the chapter (sorting, filtering, different visualizations types, aggregations, etc.).
- Our Tableau workbook consisting of at least 5 visualizations and 1 Story should be saved to Tableau Public.
- Create a Github repo for this project, and our data should be saved to that repo in a folder named data.
- Include a README.md file that describes the steps we took, our thought process as you built your visualizations and Story in Tableau, and a link to - our workbook on Tableau Public.

# 6.-  Deliverables  üì¨

- A Tableau workbook uploaded to Tableau Public that contains the visualizations and Story you created from your data set.
- A data folder containing the data set you used for our project.
- A README.md file containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualizations and organizing them into a Story as well as our results, obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and a link to our completed Tableau workbook.
